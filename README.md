## Description

A simple web status monitor / dashboard for mod_callcenter. It will show active/inactive agents and queued callers.

fsqueuemon is implemented in Python using the Flask web microframework (http://flask.pocoo.org/).
It uses FreeSWITCH's `mod_xml_rpc` to interact with FreeSWITCH using XML-RPC.

## Setup

fsqueuemon was developed using Python 2.7 and Flask 0.8.
The `queuemon.py` script can be executed to locally start a development server.
See the Flask documentation for deployment options. 

Please adapt these three settings to your environment:

* `domain` in `backends.py` should be the domain part of the queues/agents you want to display
* `URI` in `queuemon.py` to access `mod_xml_rpc`
* `hide_agents` can contain agents that should never be shown
* `hide_queues` can contain queues that should never be shown and it's agent too

## ToDo

The few strings in the UI are German right now and not yet i18nalized.
